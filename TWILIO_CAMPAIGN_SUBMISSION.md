# Twilio Campaign Submission - Updated CTA Field

## Copy This Exact Text Into: "How do end-users consent to receive messages?"

---

Tenants consent to SMS notifications through a formal opt-in process documented in our SMS Notification Opt-In Disclosure form.

LEASE SIGNING OPT-IN:
During lease execution, tenants are provided with a written SMS Notification Opt-In Disclosure form (hosted at: https://github.com/cdenmark97/rentalrelay/blob/main/SMS_Opt_In_Disclosure.pdf). This form explains the program, message types, frequency, and costs. Tenants sign this disclosure acknowledging their consent to receive property management SMS notifications.

The form instructs tenants to save their property's phone number and text HELLO to activate notifications. The disclosure explicitly states: "You can stop receiving messages at any time by texting STOP" and "Message and data rates may apply."

TENANT-INITIATED ACTIVATION:
After signing the disclosure, tenants activate the service by:
1. Texting HELLO to their property management number, OR
2. Sending any text message (maintenance request, question, etc.) to the property number

AUTOMATIC OPT-IN CONFIRMATION:
When a tenant sends their first message, they receive this automatic confirmation:
"Thanks for connecting with [Property Name] via RentalRelay! You'll receive important property updates here. Msg frequency varies. Msg&data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP for support."

OPT-OUT PROCESS:
Every message includes opt-out language (STOP to opt out, HELP for support). When a tenant texts STOP, they receive: "You have successfully been unsubscribed. You will not receive any more messages from this number. Reply START to resubscribe."

ALL MESSAGING IS TRANSACTIONAL:
All subsequent messages are responses to tenant inquiries or time-sensitive property notifications related to their tenancy (maintenance updates, lease reminders, urgent alerts). No marketing or promotional messages are sent.
