## Who We Are

RentalRelay is a property management communication platform that connects tenants with their landlords and property managers via SMS. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

When you interact with RentalRelay, we may collect the following information:

- **Phone number** — provided by your landlord or entered by you when you text your property management number.
- **Name and email** — provided by your landlord as part of tenant onboarding.
- **Message content** — the text messages you send to and receive from your property management number.
- **Lease and tenancy information** — such as your unit, property address, lease dates, and rent amount, as provided by your landlord.
- **Maintenance request details** — descriptions of issues you report via text message.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely for property management communication, including:

- Responding to your inbound text messages about maintenance, lease questions, and property inquiries.
- Logging maintenance requests on behalf of your property manager.
- Notifying your property manager of urgent issues that require their direct attention.
- Maintaining conversation history so your property manager can review past communications.

We do **not** use your information for marketing, advertising, or promotional purposes.

## SMS Messaging

RentalRelay sends SMS messages only in response to tenant-initiated conversations or for transactional property management notifications from your landlord. We do not send marketing or promotional text messages. Message frequency varies based on your conversations. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt out at any time by replying STOP or texting HELP for support information. See our [SMS Terms](./SMS_TERMS.md) for full details.

## Information Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal information or phone number with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

- **With your property manager or landlord** — your messages and tenancy information are accessible to the property management team responsible for your unit.
- **Service providers** — we use third-party services (such as Twilio for SMS delivery, Supabase for data storage, and Anthropic for AI-assisted responses) that process your data on our behalf and are bound by their own privacy and security obligations.
- **Legal requirements** — we may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government regulation.

## Data Retention

We retain your messages and tenancy information for as long as your landlord maintains an active account with RentalRelay or as required for legitimate property management purposes. Your landlord may delete your information at any time through their dashboard.

## Data Security

We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including encrypted data transmission and secure database storage with role-based access controls.
