## About Our SMS Program

RentalRelay provides an SMS-based communication service that connects tenants with their property managers. When you text your assigned property management number, an automated assistant may respond to help with common requests such as maintenance issues, lease questions, and general property inquiries. Your property manager may also communicate with you directly through this number.

This is a two-way, conversational messaging service. All messages are transactional in nature — we do not send marketing, promotional, or advertising content. You will only receive messages related to your tenancy and property management needs.

## Your Consent (Opt-In)

By sending a text message to your assigned property management number, you consent to receive SMS replies from RentalRelay on behalf of your property manager. Your property manager provides this number to you as part of your lease or tenant onboarding process.

**By texting your property management number, you agree to receive SMS messages from RentalRelay on behalf of your property manager. Message frequency varies based on your conversations. Message and data rates may apply.**

Consent is not a condition of any purchase, lease agreement, or service. You may opt out at any time. Opting out of SMS will not affect your tenancy or lease in any way.

## How to Opt Out or Get Help

You can manage your messaging preferences at any time by texting the following keywords to your property management number:

| Keyword | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **STOP** | Opt out of all SMS messages. You will receive a confirmation and no further texts will be sent. |
| **HELP** | Receive information about the SMS program and how to contact support. |
| **START** | Re-subscribe to SMS messages after previously opting out. |

You may also opt out by contacting us directly at the email address below. Opt-out requests are processed within 24 hours. After opting out, you will receive one final confirmation message.

## Message Frequency & Rates

## Privacy

Your phone number and message content are used solely for property management communication between you and your property manager.
